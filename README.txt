To run my programs open the the Assembly with UI in the title and run the Program.
There will be a ProgramUI in the folder as well which is where, surprise, I have my programs UI stored.
In challenge 3 I was unfortunately unable to fully complete it despite staying up and doing classwork
for 42 straight hours.  No joke adderall and caffeine.  I struggled understanding the format needed
to call on, use and implement Dictionaries even though I felt I had a decent enough understanding 
of the concept.  I even know about Hash Tables now which are slower than dictionaries due to boxing and 
unboxing that occurs while typing and further dictionaries, not to be confused with IDicionaries in this
case have more functionality.

Ultimately I was just about able to fully complete the UI for challenge 3. I decided to focus on finishing
the repo and UI because after all this time spent on challenges not only do I have a much, much stronger
grasp of the concepts in general but I DEFINITELY understand testing. And while in a sense I enjoy the 
challenge of creating a test and testing your test I knew it was more important to my learning to focus
on the parts of the challenge if I wasn't going to be able to finish it on time. 

In challenge 3 I had some weird issues with referencing and namespaces.  I tried several things including
but not limited to restarting my computer, hitting it and cursing it, "CRUCIO!", "IMPERIUS!" but to no avail.
I also went in and remove all the references for all the items in Challenge 3 and then reassigned them very 
deliberately.  Sometimes I had access and sometimes not.  Ultimately I just placed all my CRUD methods in the 
ProgramUI file in order to get MVP and plan to go back and suss out the rest later.

Please grade me kindly.  I spent insane amnounts of hours on this and learned an amazing amount. I lowkey 
feel like a coder now.
